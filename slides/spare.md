(50-61 Rebekah's departure)

>>>
+ LORD has spoken: so we cannot speak otherwise
+ but still emotionally reluctant
  + trad. weeks to several months preparation
  + celebrations with friends commemorating end of singleness
+ servant's focus: God has given success, now finish the job
+ Rebekah's choice: knowing would likely never see home again
+ also w/nurse (Deborah) and attendants
  + even slower journey back to Canaan

(62-67 Isaac's acceptance)

>>>
+ meditate: regular habit
  + more important what he **didn't** do:
  + didn't take matters into own hands, e.g., Abe+Hagar
+ aware of servant's mission + likely anxious
+ immediately accepted her as wife, loved her, found comfort
