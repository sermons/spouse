# Finding a Spouse <br> in God's <br> Steadfast Love
## Genesis 24
[Drew Coffman](https://unsplash.com/photos/llWjwo200fo "caption")

>>>
+ In our series on book of **Genesis**,
+ passage today is a **happy** one: Isaac + Reb!
  + **love** story, so sweet!
+ Of course, it's not actually **about** Isaac + Reb
  + and although it **is** a love story,
  + it's not about **their** love
+ But it is one of **handful** times Bible describes
  + **how** someone found their spouse
+ Feel for **singles**, esp. in **pandemic**:
  + everyday at **home** in my pajamas
  + **how** am I supposed to meet someone?

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# How do I find a **spouse**?

>>>
+ not just for **singles**, passage speaks to all of us:
+ Teens: marriage a **long** way off
  + but understand **purpose** of marriage
  + don't succumb to **pressure** to date (whether ext/int)
+ "Happy singles" not **looking** for spouse:
  + God has a **plan** for you, too (come **back** later)
+ Couples: **stuck**, done deal
  + God has **promises** specifically about marriage
  + how our rl can **grow** in faith + obedience
+ Parents w/kids @home: what **spouse** hope for kids?
+ Seniors: how **pass on** the faith in God's promises
  + that we've learned from **walking** w/Him?
+ The One who **determines** paths of our lives
  + also **redeems** our hearts + families
+ Behold the Lamb of God **[ PRAYER ]**
