# Finding a Spouse <br> in God's <br> Steadfast Love
## Genesis 24

---
[1](# "ref")
Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. <br>
And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. 
 
[2](# "ref")
And Abraham said to his servant, <br>
the oldest of his household, <br>
who had charge of all that he had

---
Put your hand under my thigh, <br>
[3](# "ref")
that I may make you swear by the Lord, <br>
the God of heaven and God of the earth, 

that you will not take a wife for my son <br>
from the daughters of the Canaanites, <br>
among whom I dwell, 

[4](# "ref")
but will go to my country and to my kindred, <br>
and take a wife for my son Isaac.

---
[5](# "ref")
The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman <br>
may not be willing to follow me to this land. <br>
Must I then take your son <br>
back to the land from which you came?” 

[6](# "ref")
Abraham said to him, “See to it <br>
that you do not take my son back there. 

---
[7](# "ref")
The Lord, the God of heaven, <br>
who took me from my father's house <br>
and from the land of my kindred, 

and who spoke to me and swore to me, <br>
‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ 

he will send his angel before you, <br>
and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 

---
[8](# "ref")
But if the woman is not willing to follow you, <br>
then you will be free from this oath of mine; <br>
only you must not take my son back there.”

---
[12](# "ref")
O Lord, God of my master Abraham, <br>
please grant me success today <br>
and show steadfast love to my master Abraham. 

[13](# "ref")
Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, <br>
and the daughters of the men of the city <br>
are coming out to draw water. 

---
[14](# "ref")
Let the young woman to whom I shall say, <br>
‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ 

and who shall say, <br>
‘Drink, and I will water your camels’ --

let her be the one whom you have appointed <br>
for your servant Isaac. 

By this I shall know that you have shown <br>
steadfast love to my master.

---
[49](# "ref")
Now then, if you are going to show <br>
steadfast love and faithfulness to my master,<br>
tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may <br>
turn to the right hand or to the left.

---
[54](# "ref")
When they arose in the morning, <br>
he said, “Send me away to my master.” 

[55](# "ref")
Her brother and her mother said, <br>
“Let the young woman remain with us a while, <br>
at least ten days; after that she may go.” 

[56](# "ref")
But he said to them, “Do not delay me, <br>
since the Lord has prospered my way. <br>
Send me away that I may go to my master.”

(1-4 Abraham's charge)

>>>
+ Abe 140yo, still 35yrs left
  + Sarah died 3yrs prior
  + Ishmael 54yo, already sent away
  + now worrying about Isaac (40yo)
  + marry own country/kin
+ servant: probably Eliezer of Damascus
  + with Abe for longer than Isaac alive
  + faithful + trusted
+ hand under thigh: solemnity of oath
  + greater responsibility than all others
+ Abe's goal: believing wife for Isaac
  + already sent Hagar+Ishmael away (as per God's command, Gal4:30-31)
  + it was Hagar who found an Egyptian wife for Ishmael, not Abe
+ who is LORD: God of heaven+earth

---
(1) Principle

>>>
+ from beginning all knew Creator
  + but quickly forgot / left
+ 1 family line that remembered God (ch5)
  + 10 gens / 1000 yrs, Adam to Noah (birth)
  + each gen teaching from father to son

---
Noah

>>>
+ God had mercy on Noah
  + but after flood, mankind again left God
  + Canaanites: under God's curse
+ 1 family line that remembered God (ch10)
  + 10 gens / 1000 yrs, Noah (birth) to Abe

---
Abraham

>>>
+ God had mercy on Abe: promise
  + Abe - Isaac - Jacob
  + estab. nation of Israel
  + chosen by God in His mercy
  + to remember the Creator
  + and pass on to next gen

---
Isaac

>>>
+ so for Isaac:
  + "marry own country/kin"
  + find a wife who will help you to
  + teach next gen to remember God
  + good wife so important!
+ same thing w/next gen Jacob/Esau 
  + Jacob went to Haran for wife
  + Esau married Hittites
+ not **legalistic** requirement:
  + **predates** Moses' law!
+ from the **beginning**, God has **revealed** Himself
  + **chosen** to have mercy 
  + on a **remnant** who remembered Him
+ so **revere** Him as holy in our homes
  + **estab.** family w/spouse who also reveres Him

---
for us today

>>>
+ raising godly **family** still critically imp.
+ **all** nations blessed via Seed of Abe
  + through whom **mystery** of gospel revealed:
+ we who are **not** part of family line of Abe
  + have been **adopted** in by grace
+ continue to **pass on** the remembrance of Creator
+ Those of us who weren't **taught** by our parents
  + have **mentors** / teachers in the faith
  + just as **Paul** was spiritual father to many
+ So when **looking** for spouse
  + whether for self or for child
+ don't just **tick** the checkbox:
  + attends **church**, got baptised
+ Find someone who **remembers** the Creator
  + and will help you **teach** to children
+ that He is **holy** + righteous
  + created us for **fellowship** w/Him
+ teach to **fear** + obey LORD
  + **repent** of our sins
+ show **mercy** to others
  + as **Christ** has to us

---
(5-9 contingency plan, God's angel)

>>>
+ singular: implying not ranking candidates, going down list
  + God will prepare one woman for Isaac
  + but she has freewill to make choice
+ Abe: stick to God's promise
+ Abe: sure that God will provide
+ free from oath: clean, empty cup, innocent of wrongdoing
+ Abe's goal: keep Isaac here in promised land
+ who is LORD: sent Abe, gave promise

---
(2) Promise

>>>
+ "To your offspring I will give this land"

---
(10-14 servant's search)

>>>
+ long distance, weeks of journey: 
  + Canaan: likely Beersheba, Hebron, or Beer-Lahai-Roi
  + Nahor: Aram-Naharaim, NW Mesopotamia
  + many supplies, gifts, need whole team: 10 camels
+ would be self-sufficient, able to draw water for camels
+ but strategic in going to well at evening
+ filtering criteria to narrow the selection
  + 20gal/camel: major effort
+ servant's goal: success, God's love toward master
+ who is LORD: God of Abe, able to grant success, chesed love

---
(3) Practise

>>>
+ 

---
(15-21 Rebekah at the well)

>>>
+ gazed in silence: still not sure, don't know her family bg

---
(22-28 servant to Rebekah)

>>>
+ gifts as token of earnestness
+ ask her family
+ immediate response: worship God
+ who is LORD: God of Abe, 
  + chesed love + truth to Abe
  + guidance to servant

---
(29-33 Laban's invitation)

>>>
+ hospitality to stranger
+ protective of sister: why gifts?
+ servant's goal: focus on the task first before food

---
(34-49 servant's recounting)

>>>
+ add Isaac's inheritance
+ who is LORD: before whom Abe has walked
  + prosper/success
+ contingency: add choice of family
+ will family show chesed love + truth to Abe?
+ tell me: turn right or left
  + respect choice either way
  + but need to know

---
(50-61 Rebekah's departure)

>>>
+ LORD has spoken: so we cannot speak otherwise
+ but still emotionally reluctant
  + trad. weeks to several months preparation
  + celebrations with friends commemorating end of singleness
+ servant's focus: God has given success, now finish the job
+ Rebekah's choice: knowing would likely never see home again
+ also w/nurse (Deborah) and attendants
  + even slower journey back to Canaan

---
(62-67 Isaac's acceptance)

>>>
+ meditate: regular habit
  + more important what he **didn't** do:
  + didn't take matters into own hands, e.g., Abe+Hagar
+ aware of servant's mission + likely anxious
+ immediately accepted her as wife, loved her, found comfort

---
(Rebekah and afterward)

>>>
+ 20yrs infertility
+ kids w/diff personalities; parents w/favouritism
+ Rebekah not perfect, either:
  + "ribqah": alluring, captivating, cord tied firmly
  + as baby: so lovely, capture heart
  + as adult: can be dangerous, use God-given beauty to persuade men to do her will
+ Jacob ("grasps, deceives") / Israel ("wrestles w/God")
  + inherited similar personality
+ focus not on how hard Isaac searched for wife
  + focus not on Reb being perfect wife for Isaac
+ but God's chesed love: faithful to promise to Abe
  + prepared wife for Isaac
  + and even more: generations afterward, whole nation

---
(characters)

>>>
+ Abe: concern for son's marriage
  + but 100% assurance in God's promise
+ servant: single-minded focus on assigned task
  + trusted God of Abe
  + only God can grant success
  + God's character is chesed love + truth/faithfulness
+ Rebekah: saw need, volunteer to serve, strength to help
  + made her own choice to follow God's call
+ Isaac: didn't do anything, waited while meditating on God's promises
  + but when God's choice was made clear,
  + wholeheartedly devoted his love to Rebekah
+ Rebekah's family: hospitality to stranger
  + understood God's sovereignty
  + but still emotionally reluctant
  + trust Rebekah to make her own choice
+ but hero of the story is always God
  + not about Abe's faith, servant's dilligence, Rebekah's bravery, Isaac's quiet times, etc.
  + God's faithfulness to His promise
  + His plan from Abe to Isaac to Jacob
  + through both royal and priestly lines, on down to Jesus
  + through whom all nations are blessed
