# Finding a Spouse <br> in God's <br> Steadfast Love
## Genesis 24

>>>
+ passage today is a **happy** one: Isaac + Reb!
  + **love** story, so sweet!
+ of course, it's not actually **about** Isaac + Reb
  + and although it **is** a love story,
  + it's not about **their** love
+ one of a **handful** of times when Bible describes
  + **how** someone found a spouse
+ feel for **singles**, esp. in **pandemic**:
  + everyday at **home** in my pajamas
  + **how** am I supposed to meet someone?

# How do I find a **spouse**?

>>>
+ not just for **singles**, passage speaks to all of us:
+ Teens: marriage a **long** way off
  + but understand **purpose** of marriage
  + don't succumb to **pressure** to date (whether ext/int)
+ Singles not **looking** for spouse:
  + God has a **plan** for you, too
  + come **back** to that later
+ Couples: **stuck**, done deal
  + but God has **promises** specifically about marriage
  + how our rl can **grow** in faith + obedience
+ Parents: 
  + what kind of **spouse** do we hope for our kids?
+ Seniors: how **pass on** faith in God's promises
  + we've learned from **walking** w/Him?
+ The One who **determines** paths of our lives
  + also **redeems** our hearts + families
+ Behold the Lamb of God **[ PRAYER ]**

+ Adam (went to **sleep**)
  + Jacob (worked **14 years**)
  + Ruth (proactive but **humble**)
  + Hosea (God used both wife + **kids**)
  + Samson (God used **despite** his poor judgment)
+ in exploring Biblical **precedent**,

  + for finding a **spouse**, bc

+ focus mostly on first **half**, for time's sake
+ (1) even w/o specific **word** from God
  + purpose not for our **happiness**
  + **remember** our Creator, pass it on
+ (2) dwell on God's **promises**:
  + knowing **who** He is gives us **confidence** / hope
  + even if people **choose** to reject His plan
  + God's **purposes** will prevail
+ (3) take **action** w/focus to see His promises fulfilled
  + praying in faith that God will reveal His will
  + being **honest** w/others: treating w/**honour**
+ We can learn sth from **each** char
  + but the real main char is **God**

And the Lord had **blessed** Abraham in all things. 

[Genesis 24:1 (ESV)](# "ref")

  + **Sarah** died 3yrs prior
  + **Ishmael** 54yo, already sent away
+ now worrying about **Isaac** (40yo)
  + knows how important a good **wife** is!
+ But Abe's not main **character** of this story;
  + not **Rebekah**: does very little
  + not **Isaac**: does zero!
+ majority of **text** describes
  + what the **servant** does:

---
And Abraham said to his **servant**, <br>
the **oldest** of his household, <br>
who had **charge** of all that he had

[Genesis 24:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (though even **he's** not the real main character)
+ probably **Eliezer** of Damascus (15:2)

(outline 2)

+ "the woman": **singular**

  + and **leads** me to find her
+ God does **His** part, I've done **my** part

+ Abe acks **freewill** of the woman
  + and takes **pressure** off Eliezer:

If the woman is **not willing** to follow you, <br>
then you will be **free** from this oath of mine

[Genesis 24:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ free: clean, empty cup, **innocent** of wrong

(anecdote)

+ our **choice** was not to choose the **person**
  + based on a list of matching **criteria**
+ but we chose to say **yes** to God's plan
  + and hence **yes** to each other
+ still **struggles** all the time in marriage,
  + but God doesn't make **mistakes**
  + He doesn't **change** His mind:

---
God is not **man**, that he should **lie**,<br>
or a son of man, <br>
that he should **change** his mind.

Has he **said**, and will he not **do** it?<br>
Or has he **spoken**, and will he not **fulfill** it?

+ He established **times** + **places** for us to live (Ac17)
+ **adopted** us into His family
  + granted **inheritance** in heaven (Eph1)
+ blessed us to become **blessing** to all nations

---
(3) Practise (v10-14)

>>>
+ most of us don't have dads **wealthy** enough
  + to send **trusted** servant to find spouse
+ possible for **parents** to find spouse
  + immense **responsibility**
+ truth is, in individualistic society,
  + we no longer **know** our kids
  + as well as we ought
  + nor do we **pray** for them / marriage
  + in the way we ought
+ e.g., **matchmakers**, church aunties
  + or even now, want to help single friends:
+ but marriage is **serious**, lifelong
  + sign of **God's** covenant love
+ not to be **trifled** with
  + not, "oh, you two would be **cute** together"
  + not so **I** take credit
+ so the task of finding a spouse
  + now typically falls to the **individual**
+ so as we read Eliezer's **dedication** to his work
  + apply **lessons** learned to
  + the **person** looking for a spouse

---
3a: Purpose (Journey) (v10)

>>>
+ long distance, **weeks** of journey: 
  + Canaan: likely Beersheba, Hebron, or Beer-Lahai-Roi
  + Nahor: Aram-Naharaim, NW Mesopotamia
+ many supplies, gifts, need whole **team**: 10 camels
  + would be **self-sufficient**
  + able to draw water for camels
+ strategic in going to **well** at evening
+ earnest **intent**
  + (v33) focus on task first before food
+ e.g., actually **praying** for a wife
  + ack want to be married
+ not dreaming of what I **get** out of it
  + meeting my needs, companionship, etc
  + being able to **say** I have a bf/gf
+ but preparing for the **commitment**
  + respect as equal but complementary

3b: Prayer (v12-14)

>>>
+ who is LORD: 
  + God of Abe
  + able to grant **success** (for Eliezer)
  + the One who **appoints** spouse (for Isaac)
  + shows chesed **love** (to Abe)
+ "Eliezer": my God is help
  + Hebrew name, not Aramaic
+ **filtering** criteria to narrow the selection
  + 20gal/camel: major **effort**

---
3c: Proposal (v22-49)

>>>
+ gifts as **token** of earnestness
  + (not to **buy** favourable response)
+ ask about her **family**
+ immediate response: **worship** God
+ **explain** entire journey
  + w/o **hiding** / duplicitous
+ who is LORD: God of Abe, 
  + chesed **love** + **truth** to (Abe)
  + **guidance** (to servant)

+ tell me: turn **right** or **left**
  + respect choice either way
  + but need to know

(50-61 Rebekah's departure)

>>>
+ LORD has spoken: so we cannot speak otherwise
+ but still emotionally reluctant
  + trad. weeks to several months preparation
  + celebrations with friends commemorating end of singleness
+ servant's focus: God has given success, now finish the job
+ Rebekah's choice: knowing would likely never see home again
+ also w/nurse (Deborah) and attendants
  + even slower journey back to Canaan

---
(62-67 Isaac's acceptance)

>>>
+ meditate: regular habit
  + more important what he **didn't** do:
  + didn't take matters into own hands, e.g., Abe+Hagar
+ aware of servant's mission + likely anxious
+ immediately accepted her as wife, loved her, found comfort

---
Rebekah and afterward

>>>
+ not "happily ever after"
+ 20yrs **infertility**
+ kids sibling **rivalry**
  + parents w/**favouritism**
+ **Rebekah** not perfect wife, either:
  + "ribqah": alluring, **captivating**, cord tied firmly
  + as **baby**: so lovely, capture heart
  + as **adult**: can be dangerous
  + use God-given beauty to **bend** men to her will
+ **Jacob** ("grasps, deceives") / Israel ("wrestles w/God")
  + inherited **similar** traits

---

+ focus not on how hard **Isaac** searched for wife
  + not on **Reb** being perfect wife for Isaac
+ but **God's** chesed love: 
  + faithful to promise to **Abe**
  + led **Eliezer** to success
  + prepared wife for **Isaac**
  + and even more: generations afterward, whole nation

---
Characters

>>>
+ Abe: concern for son's marriage
  + but 100% assurance in God's promise
+ Eliezer: single-minded focus on assigned task
  + trusted God of Abe
  + only God can grant success
  + God's character is chesed love + truth/faithfulness
+ Rebekah: saw need, volunteer to serve, strength to help
  + made her own choice to follow God's call
+ Isaac: didn't do anything, waited while meditating on God's promises
  + but when God's choice was made clear,
  + wholeheartedly devoted his love to Rebekah
+ Rebekah's family: hospitality to stranger
  + understood God's sovereignty
  + but still emotionally reluctant
  + trust Rebekah to make her own choice

---
Hero of the story

>>>
+ not about Abe's faith, servant's dilligence, Rebekah's bravery, Isaac's quiet times, etc.
+ God's faithfulness to His promise
  + His plan from Abe to Isaac to Jacob
+ through both royal and priestly lines, on down to Jesus
  + through whom all nations are blessed
