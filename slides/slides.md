# Finding a Spouse <br> in God's <br> Steadfast Love
## Genesis 24

>>>
+ 1-4 Abraham's charge
  + Abe old, established: now worrying about son
    + Sarah died 3yrs prior
    + marry own country/kin
  + servant: probably Eliezer of Damascus
    + with Abe for longer than Isaac alive
    + faithful + trusted
  + hand under thigh: solemnity of oath
    + greater responsibility than all others
  + Abe's goal: believing wife for Isaac
    + already sent Hagar+Ishmael away (as per God's command, Gal4:30-31)
    + it was Hagar who found an Egyptian wife for Ishmael, not Abe
  + who is LORD: God of heaven+earth
+ 5-9 contingency plan, God's angel
  + singular: implying not ranking candidates, going down list
    + God will prepare one woman for Isaac
    + but she has freewill to make choice
  + Abe: stick to God's promise
  + Abe: sure that God will provide
  + free from oath: clean, empty cup, innocent of wrongdoing
  + Abe's goal: keep Isaac here in promised land
  + who is LORD: sent Abe, gave promise
+ 10-14 servant's search
  + long distance, weeks of journey: 
    + Canaan: likely Beersheba, Hebron, or Beer-Lahai-Roi
    + Nahor: Aram-Naharaim, NW Mesopotamia
    + many supplies, gifts, need whole team: 10 camels
  + would be self-sufficient, able to draw water for camels
  + but strategic in going to well at evening
  + filtering criteria to narrow the selection
    + 20gal/camel: major effort
  + servant's goal: success, God's love toward master
  + who is LORD: God of Abe, able to grant success, chesed love
+ 15-21 Rebekah at the well
  + gazed in silence: still not sure, don't know her family bg
+ 22-28 servant to Rebekah
  + gifts as token of earnestness
  + ask her family
  + immediate response: worship God
  + who is LORD: God of Abe, 
    + chesed love + truth to Abe
    + guidance to servant
+ 29-33 Laban's invitation
  + hospitality to stranger
  + protective of sister: why gifts?
  + servant's goal: focus on the task first before food
+ 34-49 servant's recounting
  + add Isaac's inheritance
  + who is LORD: before whom Abe has walked
    + prosper/success
  + contingency: add choice of family
  + will family show chesed love + truth to Abe?
  + tell me: turn right or left
    + respect choice either way
    + but need to know
+ 50-61 Rebekah's departure
  + LORD has spoken: so we cannot speak otherwise
  + but still emotionally reluctant
    + trad. weeks to several months preparation
    + celebrations with friends commemorating end of singleness
  + servant's focus: God has given success, now finish the job
  + Rebekah's choice: knowing would likely never see home again
  + also w/nurse (Deborah) and attendants
    + even slower journey back to Canaan
+ 62-67 Isaac's acceptance
  + meditate: regular habit
    + more important what he **didn't** do:
    + didn't take matters into own hands, e.g., Abe+Hagar
  + aware of servant's mission + likely anxious
  + immediately accepted her as wife, loved her, found comfort
+ after:
  + 20yrs infertility
  + kids w/diff personalities; parents w/favouritism
+ Rebekah not perfect, either:
  + "ribqah": alluring, captivating, cord tied firmly
  + as baby: so lovely, capture heart
  + as adult: can be dangerous, use God-given beauty to persuade men to do her will
  + Jacob ("grasps, deceives") / Israel ("wrestles w/God")
    + inherited similar personality
+ focus not on how hard Isaac searched for wife
  + focus not on Reb being perfect wife for Isaac
+ but God's chesed love: faithful to promise to Abe
  + prepared wife for Isaac
  + and even more: generations afterward, whole nation

Characters:
+ Abe: concern for son's marriage
  + but 100% assurance in God's promise
+ servant: single-minded focus on assigned task
  + trusted God of Abe
  + only God can grant success
  + God's character is chesed love + truth/faithfulness
+ Rebekah: saw need, volunteer to serve, strength to help
  + made her own choice to follow God's call
+ Isaac: didn't do anything, waited while meditating on God's promises
  + but when God's choice was made clear,
  + wholeheartedly devoted his love to Rebekah
+ Rebekah's family: hospitality to stranger
  + understood God's sovereignty
  + but still emotionally reluctant
  + trust Rebekah to make her own choice
+ but hero of the story is always God
  + not about Abe's faith, servant's dilligence, Rebekah's bravery, Isaac's quiet times, etc.
  + God's faithfulness to His promise
  + His plan from Abe to Isaac to Jacob
  + through both royal and priestly lines, on down to Jesus
  + through whom all nations are blessed
